 * Algorithm:

 * MSGQ AND SHARED MEMORY
 * ======================
 * built out of two servers and a client
 * the program sends msg between the client
 * and each of the servers.
 * the servers share data by using shared memory
 * AS REQUIRED

 * Algorithm:
 * A program that allocates a block of shared
 * memory, then produces two processes that random
 * some of numbers until prime number.then save him in
 * shared memory, kill his brother, send signal for
 * his father and exit. dad processes prints the number and
 * exit too.
 *
 *
 * race time:
 * might have a race if the child a finds first prime,
* then second finds prime and manages to send signal first.
